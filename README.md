# Personal Configurations

This directory houses my configuration files. It's also home to probably the most intense bash setup ever.

## Better Bash Configurations

I don't use `.bashrc` (this is technically incorrect, actually) or common alternatives, not in a traditional manner anyway. Instead, I use a single `init.bash` file that initializes all of my settings and configurations in a smart way.

TODO: Write details on how all this works when I feel like writing.
