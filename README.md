# Personal Configurations

This directory houses my configuration files. It's also home to probably the most intense bash setup ever.

## Better Bash Configurations

I don't use `.bashrc` (this is technically incorrect, actually) or common alternatives, not in a traditional manner anyway. Instead, I use a single `init.bash` file that initializes all of my settings and configurations in a smart way.

TODO: Write details on how all this works when I feel like writing.

## Attributions

A huge amount of my work with Bash is owed to Ted Lilley aka [binaryphile](https://github.com/binaryphile) and his incredible [Bash series](https://www.binaryphile.com/bash/2018/07/26/approach-bash-like-a-developer-part-1-intro.html). Highly recommended reading if you're interested in Bash.

Another influence in my setup was flowblok's shell startup [setup](https://heptapod.host/flowblok/shell-startup) and diagram.
